# Informal Request - Web Development Assignment

This is a playful web page I created as part of my web development course, requesting full marks from my teacher in a fun and interactive way. The page features a creative interaction where after three refusals, the "No, I Won't" button starts avoiding the cursor, making it a light-hearted and entertaining experience.

## Features

- **Aesthetic Background:** The page is filled with aesthetic images of cats and flowers for a pleasing visual experience.
- **Interactive Form:** The page includes a form with two buttons asking the user (in this case, my teacher) to give full marks for the assignment.
- **Button Behavior:** 
  - If the "Yes, Full Marks!" button is clicked, a celebratory message appears.
  - If the "No, I Won't" button is clicked, the text changes, gently asking for reconsideration. After three refusals, the "No" button starts avoiding the cursor.
